2. Requirements Analysis: In this phase, the needs of stakeholders are gathered and analyzed to create a detailed requirement specification document.
3. Design: Based on the requirements, the software architecture is designed. This includes both high-level design (HLD) and low-level design (LLD) to outline the system’s structure and components.
4. Development: This is where the actual coding happens. Developers write the code according to the design specifications.
5. Testing: The software is rigorously tested to identify and fix defects. This ensures the product meets the required standards and functions correctly.
6. Deployment: The software is released to the production environment where it becomes available to users2.
7. Maintenance: After deployment, the software is maintained to fix bugs, update features, and ensure it continues to meet user needs.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall is a traditional project management approach that follows a linear and sequential process. Here are its key characteristics:

Phases: The project is divided into distinct phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Sequential Progression: Each phase must be completed before the next one begins.
Documentation: Extensive documentation is created at each phase.
Predictability: Changes are difficult to implement once a phase is completed.
When to Use Waterfall:

Clear Requirements: When project requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change.
Regulated Industries: In industries like construction or manufacturing, where processes are well-established and changes can be costly.
Large-Scale Projects: For projects where a detailed plan is essential to manage complexity.
Example: Building a skyscraper, where each phase (design, foundation, structure, etc.) must be completed before moving to the next.

Agile Methodology
Agile is a more modern and flexible approach that focuses on iterative and incremental development. Here are its key characteristics:

Iterations: The project is divided into small, manageable units called sprints, typically lasting 1-4 weeks.
Flexibility: Changes can be made at any stage based on feedback and evolving requirements.
